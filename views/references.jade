      We recently worked at the U.S. Armory in Washington D.C. The job 
      consisted of the removal and installation of 78,000 sq. ft. of maple 
      flooring and the rebuilding of the largest motorized bleachers on 
      the east coast. We are not, however, limited to large facilities. 
      We also work with grade schools, local dance studios, high schools, colleges, and community centers.
