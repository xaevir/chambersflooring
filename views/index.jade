      We help navigate you through the many different floor sysytems to figure 
      out what will work best for your facility. Hardwood flooring systems 
      have evolved over the years from an iron bound (tar and wood) 
      to resiliant flooring surface without deadspots. Different sports require different
      systems. Especially in todays environment. We take into consideration existing 
      doors for the profile of the floor - what the intended use and give you the 
      best floor for your dollar.

      Your dull looking gymnasium wood flooring can be restored to look new again. 
      Here’s a few reasons why you should consider sanding your court floor:
    ol
      li Due to poor adhesion of the old finish, the floor is peeling , flaking, chipping or bubbling.  
      li Multiple layers of old finish absorb the overhead lightning making the gymnasium visibly darker.
      li The finishes have worn thru and bare wood is now exposed
      li Cupped and/or stained boards that are an eyesore will have a uniform surface.   
      li Newly repaired floor  will blend into the existing  floor making the floor uniform.
      li 
        | Game-lines, lettering and logos can be updated, added or removed. 
        | Upon request, Chambers & Sons Flooring can help you create a professional layout for your facility.

      We recently worked at the U.S. Armory in Washinton D.C.
      The job consisted of the removal and installation of 78,000 sq. ft. of maple flooring
      and  the rebuilding of the largest motorized bleachers on the east coast.
      However we are not limited to large facilities. 
      We also work with grade schools, local dance studios, high schools, colleges, and community centers.  

    .page-header: h1 Annual Recoating
    p.
      Your sports floor should be screened and recoated annually. This is done 
      to rebuild the ware surface on top of the wood this also refreshes the 
      appearance of the floor to bring back the its new look. The screening 
      process consist of a very light disc sanding  removing scuff marks and 
      light scratches which dull your floor, this does not remove permanent 
      game-lines, logos, etc. Some facilities require semi-annual coatings due 
      to usage beyond sports. If your facility is also used for dances, bingo, 
      school functions, etc. this should be considered.
    p.
      Newer wood floors should have multiple coats over a several year period to get a good finish build.

    h2 Down time
    p.
      Some of the newer water based finishes only take a day to cure, so the 
      floors can be used in 24 hours after coating. Oil finish is generally 
      less expensive than water based finishes but there is more curing down 
      time for the facility. All the finishes we use are V.O.C. compliant.  
    p.
      Additional games lines, logos, lettering can be added or touched up before any finish coats are applied.

    .page-header: h1 Maintenance 
    p.
      Keeping your air filters clean is essential, dry mopping with a clean 
      mop should be done daily and recommended along with tacking the floor 
      with a non-wax cleaner  before a game. 

    .page-header: h1 Synthetic Floors 
    p.
      Rolled out rubber padding  adhered to the sub-surface and a monolithic 
      poured urethane is an excellent surface in a wide range of applications. 
      Different thickness padding and different hardness of urethane can be 
      used in  gymnasiums, jogging tracks, cafeteria’s, indoor track and field 
      that is  spike resistants.  The urethane  and rubber padding comes in 
      different  thickness to fit your facilities needs. There is also a 
      selection of the colors to  chose from along with game line coloring and 
      logos.
    p.
      Maintanence is dry mopping or wet mopping  with a netural  cleaner or auto scruber when needed. 
    p.
      Depending on use and  conidition the urethane can always be refreshed 
      with a new top coat and or a ware surface along with new gamelines  and logos.
